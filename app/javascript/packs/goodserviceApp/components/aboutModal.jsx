            <p>
              goodservice.io's goal is to provide an up-to-date and detailed view of the New York City subway system
              using the publicly available GTFS and GTFS-RT data. It is an open source project, and
              the source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/blahblahblah-/goodservice" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
              Currently, it displays live route maps, maximum wait times (i.e. train headways or
              frequency), train delays and traffic conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can view this data by train (e.g. 1, 2, A, F, L) or by line (e.g. Broadway, Lexington Avenue, Flushing), and
              they can be cross-referenced. For your convinence, you can star any train or line so you can easily access them again later.
              Slow Zones provide a current list of lines where trains have been running slow.
              The statuses displayed are defined as follow (in the order of how they are assigned):
              <ul>
                <li><strong style={{color: "#ff695e"}}>Delay:</strong> Any train associated with the train or line has been detected to not move in at least 5 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong style={{color: "#ff851b"}}>Service Change:</strong> Any train associated with the train or line is stopping at different stations than what are scheduled.</li>
                <li><strong style={{color: "#ffe21f"}}>Not Good:</strong> Difference in maximum scheduled and actual wait for a train is greater or equal to 3 minutes,
                  or traffic conditions is greater than or equal to +25%.</li>
                <li><strong>No Service:</strong> Train scheduled to run but no trains detected.</li>
                <li><strong>Not Scheduled:</strong> Train not currently scheduled to run.</li>
                <li><strong style={{color: "#2ecc40"}}>Good Service:</strong> None of the above, hooray! ðŸŽ‰</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
